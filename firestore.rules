/**
 * Core Philosophy: This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for all personal game data,
 * ensuring that a user can only access and modify their own information. A separate public leaderboard
 * allows for global read access but restricts write operations to the owner of the score.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}/gameState/{gameStateId}: Contains all private game state for a specific user,
 *   nested under their unique Firebase Auth UID. This path-based ownership is the cornerstone of the security model.
 * - /leaderboard/{playerId}: A top-level, flat collection for public leaderboard scores, designed for
 *   efficient querying.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Path-Based Ownership: User data is secured by matching the authenticated user's ID (`request.auth.uid`)
 *   with the `{userId}` wildcard in the path. This is the most secure and performant way to manage user-owned data.
 * - Public Reads, Private Writes: The `/leaderboard` collection is publicly readable by anyone (including
 *   unauthenticated users) but can only be written to by the authenticated owner of the score.
 * - Relational Integrity: On creation, rules enforce that internal ID fields (e.g., `playerId`) match the
 *   corresponding document or parent path IDs. These fields are then enforced as immutable on updates to prevent re-association.
 * - Deny by Default: All operations are implicitly denied unless an `allow` rule explicitly grants access.
 *   Permissions for operations like `list` or `delete` that are not explicitly needed are set to `false`.
